This prototype is for my final year project named "IOT BASED VOLTAGE AND CURRENT MONITORING SYSTEM FOR SOLAR CELL ON DUAL-AXIS SOLAR TRACKER PROTOTYPE".

This prototype of solar tracker was tested and the result has shown the energy output of the solar panel increased by positioning a solar panel directly perpendicular to the sun and gaining the maximum sunlight intensity.
